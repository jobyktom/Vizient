                p Integrity is our most valued asset. How Vizient conducts business reflects on our employees, customers, suppliers and members. That is why even as a privately held company, we hold ourselves accountable to many of the same governance and regulatory standards applied to publicly traded companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
                p We comply with major provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the internal control review required in Section 404. Voluntary compliance is consistent with our efforts to increase transparency to our members and other stakeholders.

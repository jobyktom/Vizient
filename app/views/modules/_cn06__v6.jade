                    h3 Overview
                    
                    p WellStar Health System needed to more quickly identify and achieve pharmacy savings to reach its overall savings goal. Pharmacy staff members lacked visibility into medication pricing at other hospitals and recent staffing changes left little time to focus on decreasing costs.

                    p VHA PharmaLYNXâ„¢ provided a clear picture of medication pricing to benchmark performance against other hospitals. It also offered access to an advisory services consultant to help interpret results, access powerful analytics and develop plans to implement opportunities more quickly.
